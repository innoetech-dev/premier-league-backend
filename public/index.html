                <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, which provided me with a strong foundation in software
                development, network management, and system administration. Throughout my studies, I gained hands-on experience in
                various programming languages such as C#, JavaScript, and Python, and developed a deep understanding of both front-end
                and back-end web development. My coursework included a focus on database management, software engineering principles,
                and cloud computing technologies. I also completed several projects, including a web-based application for inventory
                management and a custom grid component using Kendo UI in React. These projects allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge
                to real-world scenarios, enhancing my problem-solving skills and adaptability. My education has equipped me with the
                technical expertise and critical thinking necessary to excel in the dynamic field of IT and software development.</p>
                <p>During my studies, I completed several notable projects:
                - **Web-based Application for Inventory Management**: I designed and developed a full-stack application using C# and
                .NET for managing inventory in a retail environment. This involved creating user-friendly interfaces with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript, as well as implementing back-end services for inventory tracking, order processing, and reporting. The
                application provided real-time updates on stock levels and facilitated easy order management, demonstrating my ability
                to integrate front-end and back-end technologies to create cohesive solutions.
                - **Custom Grid Component Using Kendo UI in React**: I created a custom grid component for a data-rich application using
                the Kendo UI library. This project enhanced my proficiency with React, enabling me to build a highly interactive user
                interface that allowed users to filter, sort, and paginate large sets of data efficiently. The component was designed
                with performance in mind, ensuring smooth user interactions and a polished appearance.
                - **Implementing a Secure NGINX Server within a Docker Container**: As part of a course on system security, I set up a
                secure NGINX server within a Docker container. This project taught me about containerization and how to secure web
                servers against common threats. I configured SSL certificates, set up reverse proxy rules, and ensured that the server
                was hardened against attacks, providing a stable and secure environment for hosting web applications.
                - **Responsive Portfolio Website**: I designed and developed my own responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript. The website showcases my projects, skills, and achievements, and features a clean, user-friendly design that
                adapts well to different screen sizes. This project not only helped me refine my web development skills but also gave me
                a platform to present my work and capabilities effectively.
                - **Collaborative Project on Cloud-based System for Secure Data Sharing**: I collaborated with a team of students to
                develop a cloud-based system for secure data sharing. Using AWS, we built a scalable architecture that allowed for
                secure file storage, access control, and data encryption. My role in the project included designing the database schema,
                implementing user authentication, and configuring serverless functions for data processing. This experience provided me
                with hands-on exposure to cloud computing and team collaboration on large-scale projects.</p>

                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard
                    dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
                    make a type specimen
                    book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                    remaining essentially
                    unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
                    Ipsum passages, and more
                    recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
